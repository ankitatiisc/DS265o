    "### What is rotation classification task?\n",
    "One important self-training task is the task of rotation classification. Here given a set of unlabeled images, we randomly rotate it to either of the following angles {0, 90, 180, 270} degrees and train a image rotation classifier which predicts by what angle the initial image has been rotated to generate the current image. The problem is set up as a classification problem since we only rotate our images by a fixed set of angles as mentioned before and the corresponding ground truth labels being {0, 1, 2, 3}.\n",

    "Once the self-training based pretraining is done, we strip away the final classification layer(which is a linear layer) and add Convolutional or linear layers as per the downstream task's requirement.\n",

    "### Details of this problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the CIFAR-10 dataset, each class has 5000 samples and there are 10 classes.\n",
    "Split the dataset in 2 parts (A) 40000 and (B) 10000 each with equal number of samples per class in each split.\n",
    "2. Discard the labels of the samples in the first set.\n",
    "3. Take a resnet-18 (initialised) and strip the imagenet classification layer with a 4 way classification layer.\n",
    "4. Train this network on the self-training task of classifiying the rotation of the image.\n",
    "5. Once this self-supervised pretraining is done, strip the classification layer and add a classification layer for CIFAR-10 classification this is finetuned on the set B for the task of image classification.\n",
    "6. Log the loss(cross entropy) and accuracies for both the pre-training task and classfication task.\n",
